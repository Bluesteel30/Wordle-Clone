Wordle.py is a clone of the hit New York Times game Wordle. This runs 100% locally in the terminal with 0 HTML. 
It utilizes visual feedback through use of 🟥🟨🟩 emojiis. 
The Words.txt file is a modified version of one that comes from Allen Downey's Think Python book/exercise.

Create.py is also a NYT clone but of the Spelling Bee. It also runs 100% locally in the terminal. It uses an unaltered version of Allen Downeys txt file. It is much worse than the wordle clone. This is caused because A) while the Wordle clone can work with emojis, there isn't a way to good way to display the Spelling Bee B) The words_all_length file has legit words but many are unorthodox and the randomizer can't really determine letter pairings that are /intutitive.
